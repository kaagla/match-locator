# Match locator
The idea is to show Finnish football matches in the perspective of location. User can filter the search results by time period, location, league and team. The data is collected from Football Association of Finland (Suomen palloliitto) website https://www.palloliitto.fi using a Python script and stored in a database.

Technology:
- Database: MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com)
- Backend: Python Flask (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- Frontend: React (https://reactjs.org/)

Demo: https://missa-pelaa.herokuapp.com
