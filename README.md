# Match locator
The idea is to show Finnish sport matches in the perspective of location information. User can filter the search results by time period, location, sport, league and team. The match data is collected from the websites of the sport associations.

Technology:
- Database: MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com)
- Backend: Python Flask (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- Frontend: React (https://reactjs.org/) with Leaflet map (https://leafletjs.com/)

Demo: https://missa-pelaa.herokuapp.com

The objective is responsive design for the app, so that it works on any browser and screen size. The app is under continuous development and the optimization is currently focused on desktop and 4" screen size. There are some issues with small screen size.

Future development plans:
- Progressive Web Application
- New sports
